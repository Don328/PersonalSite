I had been out of the army for a little over a year. I was working as an aircraft mechanic, doing routine inspections and maintenance. I wasn't happy.

A close friend of mine was moving to Pheonix. A former co-worker of his had been trying to convince him to move down there for some time. He was making pretty good money. Ian wanted a piece of it. So did I.

We flew down and checked out these jobs.
We'd be fixing air conditioning systems.
We decided to move.

We packed up our things, drove down, and found an apartment. We started work right away.

After fixing helicopters and airplanes, working on AC systems was pretty simple. The technical aspects were never an issue. However, it wasn't long before we both came to the same conclusion. This was not what either of us wanted to be doing.

The pay was almost exclusively based on commissions. The job consisted of inspecting customers' AC systems, identifying maintenance issues, and recommending repairs and upgrades. We had nearly all of the parts necessary on hand. So in most cases, we would replace or install the necessary parts immediately.

We both noticed pretty quickly that the status quo was not something we were comfortable with. When we first started, we were riding along with other technicians, learning the job. These guys were unscrupulous.

Imagine walking into an old woman's house and trying every trick you can to convince her to buy a $350 capacitor that she doesn't actually need. Lie to her. Tell her it will save her money on her electric bill. Tell her that her AC system is working too hard. Without this capacitor, it might just give out at exactly the worst time, leaving her stranded in 115º heat, being cooked alive in her own home.

When she explains to you that she is on a fixed income, that she cannot afford it, and you just keep explaining how an electric motor or pump needs so much more power to start than it does during normal operations and that every time it clicks on without this big capacitor installed, it is shortening the lifespan of the pump and eventually, it *will* give out. Usually, on the hottest of days.

Neither of us was comfortable with the tactics. There were plenty of legitimate repairs to do without resorting to selling snake oil to people's grandmothers, we thought.

But there was a big problem.

---

This was in the spring of 2008. At the same time that we were struggling to get our footing with our new jobs, the entire global economy was collapsing. Legitimate repairs or not, business was almost non-existent. Even the technicians who were used to making $125-200k/year were struggling to make ends meet. The two of us were making almost nothing.

There came a time when we both had to come to terms with the situation. Rent was about to come due. We were both in the position where, if we paid it, we would have no money for food, gas, or anything else. We could stay in our apartment and starve, or we could pack up and go back home. If we waited, we wouldn't have the money to do either. So we decided to leave.

---
We explained our situation to the apartment management office. We asked them if there was a deal we could reach to be released from our lease. We offered to pay a couple of months' rent in installments. They told us that we would have to pay the entire remaining lease (about 10 months worth, or about $18K). This was obviously not possible. Our only reasonable choice was just to pack up and go. So that's what we did. We borrowed money from parents, we maxed out credit cards. We exhausted all of our monetary resources.

We packed up and came back to Washington.

It was barely a month before we started getting phone calls from a collection agency attempting to collect our debt. Neither of us had any money. They were calling each of us and asking for $18K. None of it seemed right, but there wasn't anything I could do at the time. I was still looking for work. I had no money.

I eventually found work through the glaziers union and started an apprenticeship program.

The collection calls stopped after a couple of months.

I was checking my credit report regularly and the broken lease had not been posted. It was late 2008.

I had plenty of other debts to worry about at that time. I spent the four years of my apprenticeship fixing my credit. The lease debt eventually appeared on my report sometime in 2009 for $12k. By the time I was a journeyman glazier (four years later), the broken lease was my only remaining debt. So I decided to do something about it.

---

My friend had gotten rid of the debt in bankruptcy a few years earlier. The collection agency hadn't called in a couple of years at this point. It was just sitting on my credit report affecting my ability to get credit. As a journeyman glazier, I was making a decent wage, but I couldn't finance a car for less than 20% interest. Buying a house was out of the question.

Before his bankruptcy, when the collectors first started calling, my friend made a very curious phone call. He was trying to get a copy of our lease from the apartment management office. But when he called, they had no idea who he was. It turns out the complex was sold to another management agency about a month after we left. To try and get a copy of our lease, they suggested we call the corporate office of the previous management group.

This had been knawing on me for a few years by this point. It just didn't seem right that they could sell the property, then charge us for months of rent afterward. I didn't know anything about tenant laws. It just didn't seem right.

At this point, it was over four years after we left Phoenix. I wanted to get rid of the debt, but I wasn't interested in paying it. It wasn't right. I was going to prove it.

I began looking through the Arizona municipal codes. It was a haystack. I didn't really know what my needle even looked like. Most of what I was reading was gibberish to my non-legally trained brain, but I just kept going back, looking for the smoking gun.

And after a few weeks, I found it!

---

When you sign a lease, you are obligated to pay it in full. This is true in Arizona and every other state, as far as I'm aware.

If you leave, you are still on the hook. The landlord, however, has a couple of obligations. After you vacate, the property owner must offer the property at a "reasonable price" within a "reasonable period" after the lease was broken. This gives them some time to perform any necessary repairs before putting it back on the market. If the property is re-rented, the broken lease is terminated. The landlord can only charge for the months that were under lease while the property was vacant.

This brings up a couple of interesting points about my case:
- The full amount of the lease (the $18k they tried to collect immediately) cannot be charged until the lease is expired. In other words, they would have had to wait another ten months to accumulate that sum.
- When the complex was sold, the leaseholder no longer had control of the property. The lease should have been terminated.

In my estimation, the most we could have been chared was maybe a couple thousand each. The more I looked, the more I was convinced that this debt was not legitimate.

---
I sent the collection agency a letter explaining what I had found and asking them to remove the debt. I laid out all of the facts in the case and cited the statutes I had found supporting my position.

Naive, I expected a response. I waited. I got none.

I needed proof that my letter had been received. So after another month, I sent it again, this time using registered mail.

Still no response.

I wrote a follow-up letter a couple months later. I restated my position and asked them to read my original letter.

After another month of waiting, I was beginning to realize that sending them letters was not going to work. I started calling them on the phone.

For about a week, my daily routine after work was to call them up and explain my position to whoever I could get to talk to me.

Nothing I was saying was getting anywhere. I felt like that old woman being sold the overpriced capacitor that she didn't need. Nothing I said would register at all. They would just keep trying to convince me that I needed to start paying them money. Eventually, we would reach an impasse. 

I would have to talk to their supervisor, they would say. 
I would be given a name and an extension. My next afternoon was planned.

By the end of the week, as soon as I called, I was told that the only person authorized to talk to me was the owner of the company. Finally, I was getting somewhere, I thought.

"Great! Can you transfer me?" I asked. Of course, he was on vacation. He wouldn't be back until Monday.

When I did finally talk to him, the results were no better. He was just like any of his employees. It was obvious. No one had read any of my letters, including him. He belittled me, told me I needed to start taking responsibility and pay my bills.

I told him that I day pay my bills. The ones that aren't fraudulent.

This was getting nowhere.

---

I hired a lawyer. I needed these people to take my claims seriously.
I was right. I knew it. 

I didn't have much money, but I was able to post a $2,000 retainer. My lawyer got to work.

I sent my attorney copies of my letters. I had been asking the collection company for copies of my account notes and had gotten nowhere. So I put him to work on that.

If you've ever retained an attorney, you already know, but everything they do on your behalf costs you money.
- A fifteen-minute conversation asking him to request my account notes: $200
- My attorney, sending an email (that I had basically spelled out for him): $200
- A ten-minute conversation where I received the requested documents and explain that I was expecting *all* of the account notes, not just a couple of random months: $200
- Attorney sends another email requesting the remainder of the records: $200
- A ten-minute conversation about the now acquired documents: $200.

You can see where this is going.

It didn't take long before my retainer was running low. My attorney called and broke down my options:

- Sue the collections agency.

*or*
- Wait until the statute of limitations runs out and file to have the debt removed

Suing the collection agency is what I really wanted to do. My attorney said that I had a decent case but that it wasn't at all guaranteed. He said it would cost me around $10k by the time it got to trial. I would be reimbursed if I won, but I would be out of pocket until then. His advice was to cut my retainer and wait. Then we could just have the debt removed.

Of course, that conversation also cost me $200, and "cutting my retainer" just consisted of not adding any more money to it because it was completely drained. Funny how that works.

---

At this point, at least I had a clear vision of the future. I just had to wait about a year and get rid of it. So I waited...

And then I received a summons in the mail. US Collections West had sued *me*.

It must have been that when they found out that I had dropped my attorney, they took it as a sign of weakness. They probably concluded that my attorney had advised me to drop it because my case was weak. Regardless of their motives, I knew I couldn't afford to re-hiring my attorney. I didn't want to add another 10k to my debt if it didn't go well. I figured I could win on the merits of my case either way anyway. I just had to figure out how to do it myself.

Just as I had poured over Arizona's municipal codes looking for my smoking gun, I started researching the procedure required to get to trial. I learned how to respond to motions. I learned to ask for extra response time due to being out of state. I learned about discovery documents and about how to bring up my own motions.

The collections company tried every trick they could to get a summary judgment (without trial). But I was able to fend off every attempt.

About six months later, the trial was finally scheduled. I bought a new suit and flew to Pheonix.

---

Let me just stop for a moment and comment on how crazy everyone thought I was. There was almost no one that thought this was a good idea. Even the people who supported me fully, my parents, for instance... I could tell they thought I was completely nuts.

"They always win. That's how it works", people would say. "They have all the money and the attorneys. You're just some dude. It doesn't matter if you're right. They'll find a way to twist it into their favor. It's what they do."

They weren't wrong. But I was determined.

---

I sat alone behind a desk on the defendant's side of the courtroom. Behind the plaintiff's desk, there were two attorneys and two witnesses. One of the witnesses was the owner of the collections agency whom I had had the pleasure of speaking to previously.

I made opening arguments, the plaintiff brought their witnesses. I cross-examined them.

Their first witness was an apartment manager for the management firm our lease had been with.

After several minutes of questions meant to establish standard practices used to offer re-rentals after leases are broken, it was my turn to ask her some questions. I could bore you with all of the details, but here's the gist of how the interview ended:

Me: "All of these things you say you do: Take out ads, make discount offers, post signs, etc., where these things are done for the apartment in question?"
Witness: "Yes"
Me: "Do you know that, or are you speculating?"
Witness: "These things are standard practice. We always do those things, so yes, they were done for your apartment."
Me: "Did you work for Alexa Lion's Gate in July of 2008?"
Witness: "Yes"
Me: "And when the complex was sold, did you continue to work for Alexa Lions Gate, or did you start working for the new management company?"
Witness: "No, I continued to work for Alexa Lion's Gate."
Me: "So you don't actually know if those things were done for *my* apartment. You weren't working there at the time, is that right?"
Plaintiff: "Objection. He's leading the witness."
Judge: "Overruled"
Me: "It's Ok. If you're just speculating, you can say it. Do you know for sure that those things were done for the apartment in question, or are you speculating?"
Witness: (after a pause) "I guess I'm just speculating."
Me: "No further questions."

---

The interrogation of Mr. Darnell was a bit more combative. I have to admit that I didn't really have a goal in mind with my questions for him. There wasn't really anything I could think to ask him that would build my case. I almost declined to question him. But he was so arrogant when we talked on the phone. I just wanted to get him to show it in court.

It was clear that I was making him angry. His attorney stepped in with an objection that I was badgering the witness.

He wasn't wrong.

The judge agreed and sustained his objection. I didn't have any more questions.

We each presented our closing remarks.

The judge had his decision right away.

---

"First, I'm going to tell you how I rule in this case," he said. "Then, I'll explain why and detail the next steps to be taken by each party involved."

I was a nervous as I have ever been.

"I find that the plaintiff has no grounds to bring this case forward."

It didn't sink in until the plaintiff's attorney stood up in protest. "Your honor..."

"Sit down. I'll explain why..."

---

The reasons he gave were my reasons. The exact reasons I had found over a year earlier, pulling my hair out combing through the AZ municipal codes. 

The very reasons I had written in my first letter to the collection agency were the legal grounds that eventually won my case.

The plaintiffs didn't even wait for the judge to finish his explanation. They requested that they be excused from the courtroom. By the time I got outside, they were long gone.

---

As part of the judgment, I was awarded some money for lost wages, airfare, etc. Compensation for the time and expense necessary to attend the trial. The judge explained the process to me:
- Wait for the payment
- Sign a Satisfaction of Judgement form
- 1 copy to the court
- 1 copy to the plaintiff
- If payment is not prompt, file for garnishment

So I waited.

After a month, I decided to write a letter. 

"The purpose of this correspondence is to collect a debt. Any and all information obtained as a result of this letter will be used for those purposes." (Of course, I began the letter like that. How could I resist?)

A couple weeks later, I received a letter from US Collections West containing:
- A satisfaction of Judgement form
- A document titled "Mutual Release of Responsibility"
- A copy of a check made out for the amount owed to me

I was a bit confused. I was expecting a check. What I got was a photocopy of said check. It didn't even show the whole thing. Only the upper half of it was visible in the copy. I decided to make a call to their attorney.

---

I played coy at first. I was a bit confused about what to do next. I explained how I was expecting a check, not a photocopy. I didn't know what this Mutual Release of Responsibility even was. The judge told me I just needed to fill out the Satisfaction of Judgement.

"The copy of the check is just to reassure you that we have the check. Just fill out the satisfaction of judgment and the mutual release of responsibility. And we'll send you the check."

"I'm still a little confused," I told him. I'm not sure where this mutual release of responsibility came from."

"We would just feel a lot better if you would fill it out and send it to us. Then we'll send you the check."

I stopped playing coy...

"I don't care about how you feel. Send me the check and I'll send the satisfaction of judgment. You aren't getting the mutual release of responsibility."

"We would just be a lot more comfortable if.."

"Send me the check. Do I need to remind you that there is a judgment against you?"

"We will send you the check. Just as soon as you..."

"Send me the check."

"Fine"

---

Another couple of weeks passed. 
I got another letter. There was a check. 
It was the same check from the photocopy. 
Finally, I had the check!

There was just one problem. The reason the photocopy only showed the top half of the check became obvious.

There was no signature.

They sent me a check without signing it.

They were still fucking with me.

---

I sent one last letter. It was short and sweet. I explained how much I appreciated receiving the check, but I had been expecting payment for the debt owed to me. I explained how I had ordered a frame and planned on hanging it on my wall once I sized a matting for the check. 

I went on that I did still expect to receive payment, however. I added a sum accounting for the court allowed interest to be charged for delinquent judgments and informed them of their new total. I said things like:

"Your conduct displays contempt for the judge, for the court, and for the law itself and is unbecoming of such an upstanding member of the Arizona Bar Association."

---

After a couple more weeks, I got the check.

I still have the unsigned check hanging on the wall in my office too.
