You get used to the sounds of the different radios after a few hundred flight hours. You can tell, just by the background noise, the static, exactly which radio the little voice in your head is coming through over.

"We can make it" It was the UHF; The "uniform" radio, so-called because of its use of the letter 'U' at the beginning of its name: Ultra High Frequency. The UHF was one of the radios used primarily to talk to tower (air traffic control).

The voice belonged to an anonymous pilot of a MH53 helicopter. There were two of them sitting on the ground in the area known as the ramp.

That's the big open area, usually between the terminal and the runway. Aircraft refuel and take on cargo there. Helicopters can take off and land from there as long as you have clearance from tower.

He did not.

The Helicopter approach at Baghdad International Airport (BIOP) was to a long strip of grass known as "center sod" that ran the length of the runway in-between it and the ramp. Like all airports, beyond each end of the runway, there was a checkpoint.

As you approach, you contact tower. You announce your location, the checkpoint through which you intend to make your approach, and your eta to said checkpoint. When you get to the checkpoint, you call again and announce that you are inbound. Each time, tower either confirms that you are clear to proceed or gives further instructions.

Leaving the airport is done in much the same way.
- Tell tower your location and desired departure
- Wait for clearance
- Report when you are outbound from your checkpoint
- etc.

My point isn't to take you through ground school or teach you the ins and outs of ATC communication. I'm just pointing out some of the basic protocols that **must** be followed to maintain areal safety.

We were inbound from checkpoint Jasmine. We called final (meaning we were at the checkpoint and inbound). That's when that guy's voice came over the uniform.

"Ehh... Tower, two 53s on the ramp requesting Jasmine outbound."

You don't think anything of it. Tower's response is what you expected. "Standby for two 47s inbound from Jasmine at this time".

Nothing out of the ordinary. Then those four words:

"We can make it."

Ok, let me back up just a little. The fact that our four massive helicopters were just about to be within about 200ft of each other was not the only thing causing stress on our crew that night. Let me introduce my pilots.

My pilots were two warrant officers, Sam and Ross. The other helicopter on mission with us that night was flown by a Captain and a Lieutenant. The Captain's name was Ryan. He'll play a role later.

Sam was an instructor pilot. Ross was in the middle of a check ride. A check ride is where an instructor administers an exam on one of the pilots or crew members. 

Check rides were administered periodically to satisfy concurrency requirements. Or when someone is being considered for progression to a more advanced classification.

Ross was being evaluated to become a pilot-in-command (PC). The minimum crew on a Chinook requires at least one of the two pilots to be a PC.

I had flown dozens of hours with Ross and never had any doubts about his abilities. Trust is a big thing between crew and pilots. You knew who was good and who wasn't. Ross was a fine pilot.

---

(Until he was on a check ride.)

Ross has a bad case of what we used to call check-ride-itis. As soon as an IP was in the cockpit with him, his brain went to jelly.

It didn't help that Sam had a well-earned reputation for being difficult to please, and that flight was no exception.

By the time we were on our approach into BIOP (remember, we were about to have a mid-air collision?), we had been flying for a couple of hours. Sam had been leaning into Ross the whole time. Before we had even made the call to request clearance, the tension in the helicopter was noticeable.

---
My usual in-flight duty position kept me sitting, rear-facing on the end of the cargo ramp. When I heard those words come across the radio, I spun my head around. I looked down the side of the fuselage, down at where they were parked. I watched them lift off and turn as they ascended, making a path that seemed intent on intercepting ours. I stood up and turned around, looking inside the helicopter through thirty feet of an empty cabin.

From the cabin, all you could see of the cockpit was the center console. The bulkheads behind the pilots' seats covered the right and the left, leaving about a two-foot slice of instruments, radios, and windshield that you could view from the cabin.

Now all I could see was a beam of light shining through the windshield originating, of course, from our devil dog daredevils. 

My eyes widen. My jaw slackens. Someone keys into the UHF radio again:

"SlidingRightToAvoidTraffic!"

It was as close to one syllable as you could imagine that string of sounds ever being.

It was Ross. 
And we slid right.

---

You may have missed his mistake.
You probably did.
Sam did not.

It's a matter of perspective. To the people behind the searchlight illuminating my cabin, "right" means something different than it is for us.

The opposite.

Knowing we'll be sliding to the right, perhaps one of the other pilots might think: "Oh, I'd better slide... left".

It might seem a bit nit-picky, but you probably don't get to walk away from this if it goes wrong.

Sam didn't waste any time. We were barely past the danger. He was already tearing into Ross for his mistake. It's absolutely none of my business how Sam chooses to train his pilots. He was and is vastly more qualified to judge his training methods than I am.

But I had to say something. We still had to land. We were still flying. We were in the middle of a big sweeping turn at the end of the sod area before we touched down on the ramp and shut down the aircraft to refuel. The last thing I needed was my pilots fighting each other while we were trying to land. I had to say something. "Sam, can this wait until we're on the ground?"

Ross: "THANK You"

Sam: "Sure"

---

We managed to land, taxi to the refueling area and shut down the engines. Right then, at that point, there was a little moment of aloneness. At the end of the shutdown process, when the electrical system is switched off, the coms your helmet stop working.

With your helmet still on, you don't hear much from around you. About the only thing that ever bleeds through the earpieces in your helmet is the relentless, high-pitched whine of the engines. That's gone now too.

I was standing at the back of the ramp (my helicopter's cargo ramp, not the airport's "ramp"). I was facing forward, into the cabin taking in the silence after such a stressful couple of hours of flight time.

My crew chiefs interrupted my meditation.

"Don!"

They were trying to get my attention.

"Don! You might want to go stop this"

They finally get my attention. I pull my flight helmet off and turn around to see Ross and Sam about 30ft behind my helicopter about to square off with each other.

---

Now, I don't mind watching a couple of guys throwing punches now and then. I'm not a big UFC or boxing buff, but I can enjoy the entertainment value in a good fight. But not like this. These guys still needed to sit three feet away from each other for long enough to make the last leg of our flight. I didn't need them reaching across the center console to sucker punch each other the whole way back to base. My crew chiefs were right. I had to do something.

I managed to get between them before they started throwing punches. Although, Ross did give Sam a big pie face as I was wedging myself between them.

Like a stern grade school teacher, I told them to get away from each other while the pilots from the other aircraft and I discussed what we should do.

Ryan (the Captain) was the ranking officer and a qualified pilot-in-command. He could take Ross as his second pilot and send the lieutenant to my aircraft. The only problem is that to do that, he would have to call operations and get clearance to change the flight manifest. Battalion would want to investigate. Someone would probably lose some rank over this. It would most likely be Ross.

---

I didn't want that. I sat back down with Sam and with Ross, and then with both of them. They both agreed, and the Captain was on board as well. As long as they agree to remain cordial for the flight home, we can squash this right here and put it behind us.

So that's what we did. I can't say that no one ever found out about it. Everyone in our Company knew within a day or so. But no one who might make the situation worse ever caught wind.

I don't think Ross and Sam ever became good friends or anything, but they both got over it. Ross ended up passing a check ride not long after and continued a distinguished career. Sam did as well, at one point being the highest-ranking warrant officer in the entire US Army.
