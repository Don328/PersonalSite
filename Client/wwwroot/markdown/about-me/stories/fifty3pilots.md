# "We can make it"
--- 
You get used to the sounds of the different radios after a few hundred flight hours. You can tell, just by the background noise, the static, exactly which radio the little voice in your head is comming through over.

"We thnk we can make it" It was the UHF; The "uniform" radio, so called because of its use of the letter 'U' at the beginnig of its name. The UHF radio was used primarily to talk to tower (air traffic controll).

The voice belonged to an annonymous pilot of a MH53 helicopter. There were two of them sitting on the gound in an area of the airport known as "the ramp". Thats the big open area, usually between the terminal and the runway. Aircraft use it to refule, take on cargo, and if you're in a helicopter, you can take off or land from there (as long as you have clearance from tower).

He did not.

The Helicopter approach at Baghdad International Airport (BIOP) was to a long strip of grass known as "center sod" that ran the length of the runway in between it and the ramp. Like all airports, beyond each end of the runway, there was a checkpoint.

As you approach the airport, you contact tower and tell them your location, which checkpoint you intend to approach from, and your eta. When you get in the general area of the checkpoint, you call again and let them know you are inbound. Each time, tower confirms that you are clear to proceed (or not).

Leaving the airport is done in much the same way.
- Tell tower your location and desired departure
- Wait for clearance
- Report when you are outbound from your checkpoint
- etc..

My point isn't to take you through ground school, or to teach you the ins and outs of ATC communication. I just want to spell out some of the basic things that *must* be done in order to maintain arial safety.

We were inbound from checkpoint "Jasmine". We called final (meaning we were at the checkpoint and inbound). Thats when that guy's voice came over the uniform.

"Ehh... Tower, two 53s on the ramp requesting Jasmine outbound."

You don't think anything of it. Tower's response is exactly what you expected; nearly word-for-word. "Standby for two 47s inbound form Jasmine at this time".

Nothing out of the ordinary. Then I heard those four words...

"We think we can make it"...

Ok, let me back up just a little. The fact that our four massive helicopters were just about to be within about 200ft of eachother, staring straight into one another's positioning lights wasn't actually the only thing causing stress on our crew that night. Let me introduce my pilots.

There were two commisioned officers flying in the other helicopter in our flight, a captain and a lutenant. My helicopter was piloted by two warrent officers, Sam and Ross. Sam was one of our instructor pilots. Ross was in the middle of a check ride.

A check ride is where an instructor (IPs for the pilots, and FI/SI for enlisted crew) administers a sort of an exam on one of the pilots or crew memebers. This is done periodically for concurrency requirements, or when someone is being looked at to progress to a more advanced classification. Ross was being given a check ride to become a pilot in command (PC).

I had flown dozens of hours with Ross and never had any doubts about his abilities. Trust is a big thing between crew and pilots. You knew who was good and who wasn't. Ross was a fine pilot.


...until he was on a check ride...

Ross has a bad case of what we used to call "Check-ride-itis". As soon as an IP was in the cockpit with him, his brain went to jelly.

It didn't help that Sam had a well earned reputation for being difficult to please, and that flight was no exeption.

By the time we were on our approach into BIOP (remember, we were about to collide with a couple of jar heads...) we had been flying for a couple of hours and Sam had been leaning into Ross the whole time. Before we had even made the call to request clearance, the tension in the helicopter was noticable.

---

The two MH53s lift off of the ground, turning as they gain altitude, bringing their trajectory on a direct collision course with ours. As soon as I heard those words come accross the radio, I spun my head around. My duty position kept me sitting on the cargo ramp most of the time, facing away from the direction of travel. I shot up and twisted around.

The cockpit was about thirty-five feet in front of where I stood. Looking forward past the narrow halway between the cabin and the cockpit, The center console window was bright with the white glow of our new friends' positioning light.

Someone keys into the UHF radio again,

"SlidingRightToAvoidTraffic!"

It was Ross. 

---

You might have missed his mistake. You probably did. Sam did not.

Its a matter of perspective. To the people behind the searchlight that was illuminating my cabin, "Right" is a completely different direction than it is for us. The opposite, in fact. Knowing we'll be sliding to the right, perhaps one of the other pilots might think "Oh, I'd better slide... left".

It might seem a bit nit-pickey, but you probably don't get to walk away from this if it goes wrong.

Sam didn't waste any time. We were barely past the danger and he was already tearing into Ross about his mistake. It's absolutely none of my buisiness how Sam chooses to train his pilots. He was, and is infinately more qualified to judge his methods than I am.

But I had to say something. We still had to land. We were still flying. We were in the middle of a big swepping turn at the end of the sod area before we touched down on the ramp and shut down the aircraft to refuel. I had to say something. "Sam, can this wait until were on the ground?"

Ross: "THANK You"

Sam: "Sure"

---

We managed to land, taxi to the refuel area, and shut down the engines. Right then, at that point, there was a little moment of aloneness. Once the helicopter's electrical system is shut down, the coms in our helmet aren't working. You still have your helmet on, so you cant hear much from around you. About the only thing that bleeds through the ear pieces in your helmet is the high pitched whine of the engines. That's gone now too.

I was standing at the back of the ramp (my helicopter's cargo ramp, not the airports "ramp"). I was facing forward into the helicopter taking in the piece and quiet after such a stressful couple hours of flight time.

My crew chiefs interupted my meditation.

"Don!"

They were trying to get my attention.

"Don! You might want to go stop this"

They finally get my attention. I pull my flight helmet off and turn around to see Ross and Sam about 30ft behind my helicopter about to square off with eachother.

---

Now, I don't mind watching a couple guys throwing punches every now and then. I'm not a big UFC or boxing buff, but I can enjoy the entertainment value in a good fight. But not like this. These guys still needed to sit three feet away from eachother for long enough to make the last leg of our flight. I didn't need them reaching accross the center console to sucker punch eachother the whole way back to base. My crew chiefs were right. I had to do something.

I managed to get between them before any real punches were thrown, although Ross did give Sam a big pie face (open had shove to the face) as I was wedging myself between them. Like a stern gradeschool teacher, I told them to get away from eachother while the pilots from the other aircraft and I discussed what we were going to do.

Ryan, (the Captain) was the ranking officer. He could take Ross as his second pilot and send the lutenant to my aircraft. The only problem is that in order to do that, he would have to radio back to our operations and get clearance to change the flight manifest...

---

I didn't want that. I sat back down with Sam and with Ross, and then with both of them. If we have to swap pilots, this isn't going to be the end of this. Battallion is going to want to investigate, and someone is probably going to loose some rank over it (probably Ross).

Ryan agreed that as long as they agree to remain cordial for the flight home, we can squash this right here and put it behind us.

---

So that's what we did. I can't say that no one ever found out about it. Everyone in our Company knew within a day or so. But no one who might make the situation worse ever caught wind.

We didn't die. No one got hurt. And no one got in any trouble over it. (Except for that MH53 pilot. Tower usually doesn't take it very well when you disrguard their commands).
