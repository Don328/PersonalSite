## Coding Skills
I am a self-taught developer. I have been learning to write code since 2018. My focus has been on the DotNet Core ecosystem (now just "DotNet")

- ### technical skills
- C#/dotnet
- Blazor
- Asp.Net Core
- Linux
- Azure
- ### non-technical(soft) skills
- **Troubleshooting and problem Solving:** This has been a strength throughout my life. I am a natural problem solver. My ability to understand complex systems and diagnose problems has always served me well.
- **Interpersonal skills:** I usually get along with most people and have the ability to put personal feelings aside in a professional environment when that is not the case. I generally maintain a positive attitude and am naturally disposed to focus on seeking a solution rather than dwelling on the effects of a problem.
- **Communication skills:** Clear communication is vital to the health of any team or organization. More than just a clear message, the ability to listen and adjust to the understanding of your audience is vital. As the receiver of a message, it is always helpful to articulate your interpretation and give feedback, clearing up any misunderstanding. This process comes quite easily to me.
- **Self-motivated learner:** From teaching myself to code to obsessively listening to history podcasts, I see no end to my desire to further my understanding of things that hold my interest. The universe of software development is vast and constantly expanding, offering endless opportunities for continued personal growth. I find no end to my interest in software development and am always looking for new challenges.
