## Coding Skills
I am a self taught developer. I have been learning to write code since 2018. My focus has been on the DotNet Core ecosystem (now just "DotNet")

- ### technical skills
  - C#/dotnet
    - Blazor
    - Asp.Net Core
  - Linux
  - Azure
- ### non-technical(soft) skills
  - **Troubleshooting and problem Solving:** This has been a strong point throughout my life, weather in school, in the military, or on the jobsite. My ability to understand complex systems and diagnose problems has always served me well.
  - **Interpersonal skills:** I usually get along with most people and have the ability to put personal feelings aside in a professional environment when that is not the case. I generally maintain a positive attitue and am naturally disposed to focus on seeking a solution rather than dewlling on the effects of a problem.
  - **Communication skills:** Clear communication is vital to the health of any team or organization. More than just a clear message, the ability to listen and adjust to the understanding of your audience is vital. As the reciever of the message, the ability to articulate your understanding of the message you have recieved is also very important. This process comes quite natural to me.
  - **Self motivated learner:** From teaching myself to code to obsessively listening to history podcasts, I see no end to my desire to further my understanding of things that hold my interest. The universe of software development is vast and constantly expanding, offering endless opportunity for continued personal growth. This, for me, is the most rewarding part of learning to code.
