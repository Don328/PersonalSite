## Work and Military History
### Military (United States Army, 2001-2007)
Highest rank achieved: E-5/Seargeant

**Job Title:** Medium Helicopter (CH-47D) repairman

Responsibilities:
- Removal and replacement of aircraft components
- Maintain aircraft maintenance records per Army regulations and aircraft manufacturer guidelines

**Job Title:** Crew Chief / Flight Engineer

Responsibilities:
- Assigned to a CH-47 helicopter as the primary flight and maintenance crew
- Maintaining aircraft maintenance logbook and co-ordinating the routine maintenance
- Pre-flight airworthiness inspection
- In-Flight airspace surveillance, systems monitoring
- In-Flight Troubleshooting
- In-Flight emergency procedures
- In-Flight mission impact assessment after maintenance or emergency events
- Loading and securing of cargo with flight safety and center of gravity considerations
- (as a flight engineer) Primary trainer and supervisor of crew chief(s)
- Co-ordinating maintenance with general and specialty maintenance sections
- Supervision of *all* maintenance done on assigned aircraft
- Training and instruction of assigned crew chief(s)

**Job Title:** Company Armor

Responsibilities
- Security and maintenance of all company weapons and sensitive items secured in the company arms room
- Troubleshooting and maintenance of various weapon systems

**Accomplishments**
- During my military career, I progressed quickly, making the rank of specialist (e-4) at the earliest time allowable with the use of a time in service waiver. I was then sent to the E-5 promotion board not long after and was given the rank of Sargeant after about three years of service (very fast for an aviation unit). At about the same time, I was taken out of our maintenance unit and assigned to the flight platoon. I quickly progressed as a crew chief and became a flight engineer after about two hundred flight hours (much lower than average).
- Over the course of a one year deployment to Taji, Iraq, I maintained my assigned helicopter with an operational readiness rating of over 90% which was the highest in a fleet of twelve CH-47 helicopters. This was accomplised while logging over 500 flight hours in the aircraft and performing a major periodic inspection (phase inspection) within the course of the year.
- One of the greatest measures of a flight engineer is the progression of the crew chiefs who are assigned to them. At the begining of our deployment to Iraq, I was assigned two new crew chiefs, neither of which had any experience. By the end of our year long deployment, both of them were respected crew members in our unit and within six months of our return to the states, both of them were given (and passed) check rides to become flight engineers.

## Coding Skills
I am a self-taught developer. I have been learning to write code since 2018. My focus has been on the DotNet Core ecosystem (now just "DotNet")

- ### technical skills
- C#/dotnet
- Blazor
- Asp.Net Core
- Linux
- Azure
- ### non-technical(soft) skills
- **Troubleshooting and problem Solving:** The ability to isolate a problem into its component parts and find a solution has been a strength throughout my adult life.
- **Interpersonal skills:** I usually get along with most people and have the ability to put personal feelings aside in a professional environment when that is not the case. I generally maintain a positive attitude and am naturally disposed to focus on seeking a solution rather than dwelling on the effects of a problem.
- **Communication skills:** Clear communication has been a necessity in several positions I have held. From crewing a helicopter to running a construction crew, the ability to communicate clearly both as the sender *and* reciever of information has been an asset.
- **Self-motivated learner:** In addition to teaching myself to code, I am also an avid history podcast/audio book listener. When I find a topic that interests me, I dive in head first.
